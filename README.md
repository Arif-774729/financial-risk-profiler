# Financial Behavior Risk Profiler

This project uses machine learning to analyze and predict financial behavior risk profiles based on real and synthetic datasets. Designed for use in banking and fintech applications, this pipeline can be extended for credit scoring, loan default prediction, and risk-aware customer profiling.
